# Arduino-Football-Game
Group Project for course MA2012 at NTU\
This contains the code for a 2 player football/soccer penalty game with one shooter and one goalie which is controlled using Arduino UNO. \
# Cannon_Code
is used for the cannon. \ 
We use 
# 2 servo motors
for rotation (controlled by joystick) and release of the cannon (controlled by pushbutton)  \
# FOOTBALL_GOALIE_DC and football_goalie_servo 
are used to move the goalie sideways (controlled by joystick) using a rack and pinion and for it to dive (controlled by joystick) \
# FOOTBALL_Ultrasonic_Sensor
